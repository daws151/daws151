- 👋 Hi, I’m @daws151
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development of both web and desktop applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# (+ ASP.NET), Java, Python, JavaScript (+ Node.js), and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m still in school, so not looking to collaborate on any outside projects yet.
- 📫 How to reach me - email is preferred
